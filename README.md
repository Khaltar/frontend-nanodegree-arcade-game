# Classic Arcade Game Frogger (in a Buggified-Version!)

## Description
This is a game trying to mimic the old nostalgia classic Frogger made with Javascript as part of the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree at Udacity. The objective is simple: from the starting position just cross the field avoiding the stampede of bugs to reach the water at the other side that will enable you to escape from the bug invasion (good thing bugs can't swim!)

## Installation
The installation is simple. Just fork this repository to your pc using github and run index.html.
If you don't know how to work with Git yet, you can find the game ready to play [here](http://khaltar.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game).

## Controls
Just use the directional keys to move your character. To choose the gender of your character just type boy or girl when asked at the beginning of the game.

## Game Mechanics
* You will get 100 points every time you reach the water.
* You will lose half of your current points when you collide with a bug.
* You have 3 lives and each time you collide with a bug you lose a life.
* When all lives are gone, the game restarts.
* There is not much extra functionality or a way to win the game: just try to get a high score until you are bored.

## Known bugs
* Nothing game-breaking
* There's a known bug that shows when the character gets to the water. Canvas renders a portion of their head forever (will be solved ASAP)

## Contributions
Anyone who wants to help adding some functionality to the game or correcting some bugs is welcome. Just fork the repo and send a pull request.
